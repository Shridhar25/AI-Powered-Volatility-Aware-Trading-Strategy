# AI-Powered-Volatility-Aware-Trading-Strategy

The project focused on designing an AI-powered trading strategy that adapts to market volatility. A deep learning algorithm was developed, integrating LSTM-based price prediction with technical indicators like SMA and RSI for dynamic trading decisions. A volatility-based switch and an ATR filter were used to enhance the timing and execution of trades. The strategy was rigorously backtested to evaluate its effectiveness under varying market conditions.
